 I was an FTE for several years and now an external doing an distributed informational interview. Pretty sad and disappointing 
 to know the process is so broken. Had heard negative stories from others but didn't believe it until I became an 
 external again. They simply do_not respond to you if they aren't moving forward with you. Not even a courtesy email.
 I wish they put some feedback process in place to check on these distributed vendors-recruiters' work. They leave bad impression, 
 which is totally against their hiring principles.
